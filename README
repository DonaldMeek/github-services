The github-services application uses Spring Boot to provide an efficient 
and flexible interface to the GitHub Developer REST API. A tree-based data
structure stores the followers and stargazers for any GitHubId up to 3 levels
deep. Test-Driven Development with JUnit and Java Code Coverage works to attain
code coverage of 36% for github-services and code coverage of 92% for all data
structures. With modular and extensible classes, github-services aims to 
exceed code chalenge requirements.
